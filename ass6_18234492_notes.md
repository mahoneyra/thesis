# Assignment 6: Part Two

Version control allows individuals to keep track of changes made to code to allow them to revert to previous versions if needed. Git is a system that carries out version control and its counterpart Github can be used to host the versions online. This tutorial will outline how Git can be used to document code by simulating ChIP-Seq research used to identify CTCF binding sites in kidney epithelial cells using three files. process.sh will be used to download sequence information, clean.py will be used to peak call and filter the data and analyze.R will be used to plot peaks.

## Installing and Configuring Git
Git can be downloaded on Linux systems by using the shell commands below. An account must then be setup and a username and email address must be supplied.
```{bash}
#Get updates and install git
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git -y
#Set up username and email
$ git config --global user.name "Rebecca Mahoney"
$ git config --global user.email "rebeccamahoney@outlook.com"
```

## Create Directory for Current Code
The code that will be changed must be in its own directory as  git will be initialised only in this directory and as such only chn=annges made to thesee files will be tracked. A directory called thesis was set up and the three files placed in it using the shell commands below. Git was then initialised.

```{bash}
#unzip file
$ cd Downloads
$ tar xvf codes.tar
#make thesis directory and move files to it
$ mkdir -p ../thesis
$ cp code/*  ../thesis
$ cd ../thesis
#initialise git
$  git init
```

Versions of a file can be saved by first adding and then commiting the file to the git repository. Failure to do this will result in the altered file only exsisting in the working directory. Adding files moves them to the staging area while commting added files moves them to the repository . Once committed it is assigned an identifier which allows this specific verison to be referred to. Identifiers can be viewed using the log command. Additionally,the status command can be used to view files being commited (or uncommitted files.) The shell commands below check intial status which is unsaved and then add and commit all files to the repository. A message must also be passed using the -m flag to describewhat is being done to the code. In this case this initial commit is performed.

```{bash}
#get status
$ git status
#add files
$ git add process.sh clean.py analyze.R
#commit
$ git commit -m "inital code version"
#find identifier
$ git log
```
The output of the log command can be seen below. It shows the identifier given to this version and shows that this is the inital commit.

## Making Changes

The original versions are now saved so changes can be made. The fold change is used to filter peaks and was changed in the clean.py file from 20 to 10 to allow for a stricter threshold. This was carried out but opening clean.py up in text editor nano and manually changing the threshold. The status command was ran and it was noted that git had observed that changes had been made but not comitted. 

```{bash}
#alter threshold
$ nano clean.py
#check status
$ git status
```

The changes can be viewed using the diff command.

```{bash}
$ git diff
```
The output of this above command can be seen below. The line added is shown in green with a '+' and the line removed is denoted in red with a '-'.

## Removing Changes

Files can be restores to the last version in the staging area which is the last version subjected to the "git  add" command.  As there are no current versions here, the file will return to the version of the last committed file.  If you wanted to return to a specific version, the -- can be replaced with the first 7 characters of the identifier.

```{bash}
git -- checkout clean.py
```

##GitHub

GitHub hosts/stores repositories created on git so that they can be viewed by and shared with others.  A github account was created and a remote repository called thesis was created to match the local repository. The local repository was connected to the remote repository using the shell git add remote command. The commited files can then be added to the remote repository using the push command. Origin is used as as shortcut to avoid typing the repository url. To move files back to the local computer the git pull comand can be used

```{bash}
# connect remote and local repository
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/mahoneyra/thesis.git

#push commited files to remote repository
$ git push origin master

#pull to local repository
$ git pull origin master
```

To avoid commiting unwanted files a file called gitignore can be created to tell git which subdirectories and files it can ignore. If you want to keep all commited files as they are but still make changes a copy of the remote repository can be made using the git branch command which allows chanegs to be made while keeping an unaltered master branch. Copies can also be made in a local repository using the git clone command.

In conclusion Git is a useful tool which allows code to be altered while also saving previous versions in an easy and efficient way while GitHub facilitates code sharing and also provides an online backup of code. The link to my GitHub account is: https://github.com/mahoneyra/thesis
